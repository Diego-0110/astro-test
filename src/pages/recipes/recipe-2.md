## Ingredients

- 8 oz (225g) of your favorite pasta
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 can (14 oz / 400g) of diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup of heavy cream
- 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup of fresh basil leaves, chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)

## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.

3. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

4. Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice) to the skillet. Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken.

5. Reduce the heat to low, then pour in the heavy cream and grated Parmesan cheese. Stir well until the sauce becomes creamy and the cheese is fully melted.

6. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss it in the creamy tomato sauce until well coated. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the pasta through.

7. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the chopped fresh basil leaves. 

8. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.

9. Serve the creamy tomato basil pasta hot, garnished with extra grated Parmesan cheese and a sprig of fresh basil.

Enjoy this delicious and comforting pasta dish as a quick weeknight dinner or for a special occasion.
